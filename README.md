About:  This project tackled the challenge of using machine learning to solve algebra word problems.

Data:  Leveraging a dataset from Hugging Face, we extracted a subset of 100 samples for initial model development and testing. This is a common approach to ensure proper model function before scaling to the full dataset.

Model Architecture:  I built the model using PyTorch. The core component is a pre-trained transformer model, specifically the Lemma2 architecture from the Hugging Face library. Transformers excel at analyzing sequential data like natural language, making them well-suited for understanding and solving word problems.

Training Process: The model was trained on the 100-sample dataset. During training, the model learns the relationship between the natural language description of the problem and the corresponding solution, typically expressed as a mathematical equation.It also uses 3 porch for reducing traning loss.

Output and Constraints:  The model is configured to generate concise solutions, with a maximum output length of 200 words. This ensures focused answers while maintaining flexibility.
